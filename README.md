This project contains two minimal examples for combining Go code with Qt GUIs.

* **Standalone**: A simple GUI frontend calls a Go executable
* **Sharedlibrary**: A simple GUI frontend calls a shared library written in Go

Note that this is about how to consume Go code in Qt, not about how to use Qt in Go.
