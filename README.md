# GoTranslate [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/probonopd/QtGoTranslate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/probonopd/QtGoTranslate)

This project contains two minimal examples for combining Go code with Qt GUIs.

* **Standalone**: A simple GUI frontend calls a Go executable
* **Sharedlibrary**: A simple GUI frontend calls a shared library written in Go

Note that this is about how to consume Go code in Qt, not about how to use Qt in Go.
